    <title>UN Sustanable Development Goal 9 && AI </title>

<H1>Generative AI and the UN SDG 9</H1>
<P1>The United Nations Sustainable development goals are set out as a call to action,
 it can help us create a better and more sustainable world by 2030.
 The main calls are 1. End poverty and hunger, 2. Protect the planet, 3. Ensure prosperity and peace for all.
 There are 17 goals, and I will be focusing on the use of AI on goal no 7.
 Artificial Intelligence plays a crucial role in advancing the sustainable development goal 9 by enhancing industrial efficiency,
enabling smart infrastructure, and fostering innovation, though it also poses ethical and economic challenges.(UN,2025)
 I believe AI can be used in a number of ways to help humanity as a whole and promote the aims of the United Nations.</P1>

 <P2>“It is very difficult to focus on all the SDGs while also trying to decrease carbon emissions and limit the climate temperature to 1.5°C
 above pre-industrial levels. The SDGs focus on improving the current world situation with the help of all countries, 
 but challenges are much greater for undeveloped countries than developed countries at this stage.” (Mahadi, E. (2020)) 
 This quotes highlights some of the challenges with using AI for the goal 9 as AI uses a lot of power about 460 TWh in 2022. 
 (Vincent, J. (2024)) and most of this power comes from burning oil and gas so using it to help the environment is kind of pointless 
 as your damaging the environment to save the environment.</P2>

<P3> AI can have a huge impact on industrial manufacturing from developing power efficient and increase material efficiency,
 this will lower build cost and lower the impact on the environment. 
 They can use AI for predictive maintenance to ensure minimal downtime on critical structures. 
 Oracle say that using predictive maintenance can boost factory uptime by 15% (Jackley, M. (2025)) 
 it can also save a company money by replacing physical workers also by keeping systems up for longer can ensure that less material is wasted due to faults with the manufacturing process.
  There also some negatives that come along with this, Possibly job loss for roles that are being replaced with AI, 
  could be a quite high cost to set up and get running the AI systems, also not all countries have the same access to AI technology
  as 1st world countries meaning it would be harder and more expensive to implement. But I do believe that mass implementation of AI
   will allow organisations to produce more products reduce3 waste and system downtimes with predictive maintenance. One of the worst
    things for an organisation is when you are unable to fulfil orders, machine downtime makes you unable to fulfil orders so reducing
    this will increase your customers trust that when they place an order that they will get there product in a timely manner without 
    complications.</P3>
