<p>The integration of generative AI into everyday life has had a profound impact both societally and economically. The tool has potential including creating opportunities for individuals and companies to increase their efficiency and productivity. Many are unaware of the impact caused by their usage, including both everyday users and corporations with “only 12% of executives confirming that their organizations measure Gen AI’s footprint” (Capgemini Research Institute. (2025) Developing sustainable Gen AI, Available at: <a href ="https://www.capgemini.com/insights/research-library/sustainable-gen-ai/"> click here </a> (Accessed: 19 October 2025)).  </p>

	Large organisations that are now incorporating AI into their systems should be required to internally assess the environmental impact of their generative AI usage. Governments lack laws to mandate companies to be transparent about their individual impact, with current proposed legislation (The EU AI Act) not including any environmental points , creating laws on maximum power usage per AI model may push developers and potentially companies to look for more methods to be energy efficient, especially if fines and penalties are put into place. If AI developers and these organisations made their energy consumption figures due to generative AI public and governments created public resources to create awareness of impact, this could to users being more responsible which could reduce emissions, “A study by the Boston Consulting Group even stated that if AI is used wisely, it could help mitigate 5 to 10% of GHG emissions by 2030” (Dhanani, R. (2024) ‘Environmental impact of generative AI – 30 + stats & facts’, The Sustainable Agency. Available at: <a href="https://thesustainableagency.com/blog/environmental-impact-of-generative-ai/"> click here </a> (Accessed: 16 October 2025)). Governments could also include the environmental impact of generative AI in standard school and university curriculums, as the majority of users of generative AI being within the Gen Z age bracket  (between 1997 and 2012) and likely in the near future, Gen Alpha.</p>

<p>Using smaller, more energy efficient models and the latest hardware for servers can also reduce impact as they require less energy to run. One of the latest examples being Google's TPUs being created specifically for machine learning tasks and offer a higher performance-per-watt ratio in contrast to traditional GPUs, leading to increased efficiency with AI usage (Pangotra, A. (2024) ‘Generative AI and Environmental Risks’, CyberPeace. Available at: <a href=" https://www.cyberpeace.org/resources/blogs/generative-ai-and-environmental-risks?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> click here </a> (Accessed: 17 October 2025).).  Using large scale generative AI models consumes large quantities of energy a prominent example being ChatGPT 5, “A single ChatGPT inquiry consumes about five times more electricity than that of a web search,”. Switching to models such as Google Gemini Nano, which releases information on it’s energy usage, an example being for each individual query a user submits they have reduced power consumed by generating a response by 33 times the amount within the past year (Vahdat, A. & Dean, J. (August 2025) ‘Measuring the environmental impact of AI inference’, Google Cloud Blog, Available at: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/measuring-the-environmental-impact-of-ai-inference"> click here </a> (Accessed:15 October 2025).), can help reduce the energy consumption that response generation causes, while still providing a quality generative AI system for users. Smaller AI systems also require less training, the process of training a generative AI system consumes huge amounts of energy, an example being ChatGPT-4, “it’s estimated that training OpenAI’s GPT-4 took over $100 million and consumed 50 gigawatt-hours of energy” (James O’Donell and Casey Crownhart (May 2025) ‘AI energy usage climate footprint big tech’, Technology Review, 20 May. Available at: <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/"> click here </a> (Accessed: 19 October 2025).). For scale 50 gigawatt-hours of energy you can also power 50 million households for 1 year. </p>

Using renewable energy sources to power the huge amount of energy the servers AI is hosted on is another potential method to reduce its environmental impact, governments could either require or incentivise renewable energy usage for large data centres. Moving these servers to areas where there is readily available access to renewable energy or even just creating easy access onsite (through solar panels on the roof of the data centre or putting it somewhere remote where wind turbines can be placed or hydroelectricity can be generated). Solar panels are likely the most effective solution as they harness energy efficiently without releasing Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere, however they can take as long as 15 years to pay themselves off (in a standard household use case, as I could not find it for an industrial scale) .  Which for the amount of energy that a data centre consumes (“in the US Data centres accounted for approx. 4.4 percent of all energy consumptions in 2023” (Kandemir, M., 2025. AI’s Energy Demand: Challenges and Solutions for a Sustainable Future. Institute for Energy and the Environment, Penn State University. Available at: <a href="https://iee.psu.edu/news/blog/why-ai-uses-so-much-energy-and-what-we-can-do-about-it"> click here </a> (Accessed 17 Oct. 2025). </p>

<p>Ai Can also make a positive impact on the environment which can help negate the negative aspect, there is a video linked below outlining this for further information: </p>
