                <h2 id="roles">Roles of Each Person</h2>
              	<p>In our group, each member played an important part in ensuring the success of our website project, with everyone taking on different roles that reflected their individual strengths and working styles.<br><br>
Matthew worked well as the resource investigator, always looking for new ideas and tools that could help the group improve its workflow. He introduced us to GitHub, which allowed for smoother collaboration for our website, and to Zotero, which made managing our references and sources much easier. Matthew’s section focused on UN Goal 9, which he completed to a high standard, and he also supported others with tasks like improving the CSS and working on the bibliography. His enthusiasm for exploring new approaches helped the team stay innovative and organised, and he often encouraged others to try out different methods of working.<br><br>
Chris acted as both an implementer and a co-ordinator, showing communication and organisation skills throughout the project. He was always checking in on Teams to make sure everyone was on track and arranging group meetings. Chris was a key figure in the technical development of the website, creating the home page, the “What is Generative AI” page, and the conclusion page, as well as helping with the credits. He also contributed heavily to the CSS, refining the navigation bar so that it looked professional and functioned smoothly. He helped keep the group organised and motivated.<br><br>
Freya took on the role of the shaper, showing strong determination and focus on her individual tasks. She focused on making sure work was created to a high level. Freya produced many visually impressive elements of the website, particularly through her work on the CSS and the navigation bar. She also created the page on how to fix the impacts of generative AI, which was an important section of the website.<br><br>
Amna fulfilled the role of the specialist within the group. She worked diligently and with great focus on her section about the environmental impact of generative AI. This page became a crucial part of the website, providing in-depth research and analysis that strengthened the overall project. While she concentrated mainly on her individual section, the quality of her work showed her dedication and expertise. She made sure her page was clear and informative, contributing significantly to the educational value of the website.<br><br>
Nossier took on the role of the team worker, constantly supporting and motivating others. He completed his own section on the uses of generative AI, particularly its applications in schools and workplaces, to a high standard and always ahead of schedule. Beyond his own work, he helped others with technical and design issues, played a major part in putting the website together, and attended every meeting. His positive attitude and reliability made him a key part of the group’s success.<br><br>
Andrew was also a strong team worker, showing the same willingness to help others while maintaining high standards in his own work. He completed the section on UN Goal 3 and contributed to both the bibliography and credits pages. Andrew was consistent in showing up to meetings and communicating well with the group, often checking in to see what still needed to be done and offering support wherever possible.<br><br>

				<h2 id="hywt">How you worked together(examples of planning, intermediate milestones)</h2>
				<p>As a team, our main milestones included finishing the CSS and the home page early in the project. This was a major advantage, as it allowed us to build the structure and layout of the website first before moving on to filling in the content and fine-tuning the details. Completing these core parts early meant we could work more efficiently later on, focusing on improving quality and adding features.</p><br>
				
				<h2 id="teameff">What you did to ensure your team worked effectively</h2>
				<p> We organised lots of meetings to constantly check up on our groups work and ensure it was of a good standard. We delegated tasks based off of peoples strengths in the group and checked up regularly.</p><br>
				
				<h2 id="decisions">Decision-making process used</h2>
				<p> If we ever had a decision to make we would discuss as a group and come to a conclusion together. If someone was passionate about something we allowed them to take charge as long as they effectively communicated with the group. </p><br>
				
				<h2 id="reflection">Reflection on how well you worked together, lessons learned and what you could do to make things even better</h2>
