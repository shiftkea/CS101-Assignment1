    <h1 id = "backtotop">United Nations Goal 3</h1>
    <p>Imagine a world being better educated, safer, and fed, with less suffering and furthermore a sunny Scotland.
       Maybe the last one is a bit far-fetched but you get the point. The United Nations (UN) has set goals to get closer
       to the ideal life for everyone globally. I’ll show you how generative AI can help, putting some focus on goal 3 
       “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” (Goal 3 | Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2025)
       A very important concept that generative AI has enhanced and hopefully can continue to.

       Technology allows for development in the healthcare sector such as improved pharmaceutical innovation, which is just a fancy couple of words for 
       development of drugs. The helping kind, none the recreational nonsense. Another aspect that is quite interesting and very useful 
       is personalising medication to individuals. Aiming to reduce the impact of diseases/illnesses. I will explore how generative AI 
       can contribute to the United Nations goal 3.

    <br>
    <p>Generative AI can benefit the medical industry significantly with more effective drug discovery methods, the software
        looks at various different molecular structure combinations and can model the outcome of lots of different variations 
        of drugs(Reddy, 2024). The technology will test lots of different drugs at once, picking the ones most likely to work and put them 
        into real life testing, in the form of clinical trials, normally as step one. In a study, it was concluded that 90 
        percent of clinical trials did not work (Reporter and Francisco, 2025).
        The process of creating cures and or managing the impact on the human body, 
        for diseases is way more efficient: quicker and cost effective with the help of generative AI (Thacharodi et al., 2024). 
    </p>

    <p>
        The price of clinical trials in the UK can vary a lot and depend on many factors but most clinical trials cost around a million pounds(Hind et al., 2017). 
        Charities, government and drug companies are the way in which most drugs research and development are funded in the UK (How clinical trials are funded in
        the UK | Cancer Research UK, 2025). By reducing the costs, more life saving treatments can be discovered and extra money into the NHS and improving health
        and wellbeing will be very helpful. The current time taken to create a new drug can be anywhere from a decade to a decade and a half (Trust, 2025). With the 
        use of Generative AI the aim is to reduce the time taken so the impact of diseases is minimised.</p2>

    <p>Another example of a great use of generative AI, personalised treatment. Medicine based on a persons genomic sequence,
        and specific mutations to better treat patients(Reddy, 2024). Generative AI does this by analysis and simulating the outcome of (specific) drugs. Personalised
        medicine can be used to treat cancer, it is a good example since there are a couple hundred different types of cancers(Cancer, 2025).      
    </p>
     
        <img src="images/Genomic-Sequencing-Blog-Feature-1.png" id="MatthewsPhotos" alt="Genomic-Sequencing-Blog-Feature-1.png" >

    <p>
        Machine learning has enabled the technology to read and identify trends, which medicines work well corresponding to their “patients genetic makeup, lifestyle and medical history.”
        (Thacharodi et al., 2024). Cancer is a disease which causes cells to grow excessively and in an uncontrolled way. Cancer was the cause of death for just under
        ten million people worldwide in 2022 and statistics show around twenty percent of  people will develop cancer in their lifetime(Global cancer burden growing, 
        amidst mounting need for services, 2025). By implementing treatment specific to individuals, we can try to “ensure good health and wellbeing for all.”
    </p>
    <p>Autoimmune hepatitis is a unique, uncommon illness that affects the liver (Mills, 2024).
      Some patients do not improve with regular methods of treatment. “After looking in more detail at her immune response, using one of the recently developed national genetic panels , it was discovered that she was born with an extremely rare mistake in her body’s defence system, which had likely triggered autoimmune hepatitis.” The medical professionals tailored a medicine right to the patients needs, the traditional method did not work and so turned to another method. The patient now half a decade on is doing a lot better all due to the use of personalised medication.</p>
        <br>
<br> 

    <p>In the education side of things, generative AI can be very useful to learners. Generative AI allows for medical 
        students to simulate and experiment with situations created by the software(Reddy, 2024). This means that pupils can learn and 
        practice with no bad implication of any mistakes made, patients will still have all 10 fingers. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The use of AI can help teachers by keeping a record of the strengths and weaknesses of the class. Which means key areas that may need 
        to be recapped and further explained can be identified. The universally understood feeling of stress or anxiety or 
        other mental struggles, can commonly be a result of school, university, college work etc. Would you be surprised if 
        I told you Generative AI can help? Probably not, it's getting to the stage where you have to wonder what can't it do! 
        AI can help with worries and stress or negative feelings by responding to what you send (Akbar, 2025). Services such as Chat GPT or 
        generative AI software specifically targeted at tackling mental health can be helpful, especially for those who may 
        struggle with approaching or reaching out to a human being for help.
    </p>

        <img src="images/mentalhealth.png" id="MatthewsPhotos" alt="mentalhealth.png" >
    
    <p>
     Which means that more people can get some support which may ease worries and stress. A massive benefit of it also is that the technology does not need sleep as such so it 
        is accessible over the internet anytime and from anywhere.  
    </p>
<br>
<br>

    <p>Generative AI is a great tool with many benefits including helping students with learning by creating study planners 
        and organising information, this can make students more effective with revising. Revising, an activity that I've never 
        enjoyed particularly, and not many do. We as humans may be tempted to put off the work and leave it as late as 
        possible in some cases (Student Syndrome: Why People Delay Until Right Before Deadlines – Solving Procrastination, n.d.). This is more stressful and the quality of work may not be to the best of the students ability(Adeel et al., 2023).

        <img src="images/stresssing.jpeg" id="MatthewsPhotos" alt="stresssing.jpeg" >  
 
    <p>
        Using a study planner generated to a students specific needs, will helpm students to be better structured and so in a 
        better routine(Making a revision timetable that actually works - The Uni Guide, 2025). Students am more likely to be prepared for tests and have enhanced understanding of concepts and improve 
        the tedious chore of studying!  Students will appreciate AI a little more since it gives out immediate responses. Which means time 
        can be saved and enable anyone to work continuously without having to wait for human input. Therefore more work is 
        able to be completed in a shorter space of time and additionally the use of AI by students, can cause less stress for 
        educators. There are less emails and Microsoft teams queries to respond to (mediaofficer, 2025). This will leave more time for the 
        things enjoyable in life.

    <p>
        Furthermore AI can help find the appropriate study resources, like videos or websites to assist with learning if students become stuck and need more support. For more infotmation on this  <a href="genUses.html">click here</a>.

     <br>
     <br>
    <p>I support the use of AI in the future, I have explored how the use of generative AI can be of huge benefit in a general sense, 
        and also towards getting closer to the UN goal objective to “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.”
        I hope to have widened your understanding of the good in which generative AI is capable of, as the technology is not 
        always shown in good light. Generative AI can have lots of health benefits such as personalised treatment, better drug 
        development and better education for medical professionals. Day by day we are seeing more progress, and there is still 
        lots more to discover. Generative AI is how we can move forward and it is fuel innovation.
